<h1 id="an-overview-of-chef">An Overview of Chef</h1> <p>Welcome to Chef!</p> <p>Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms complex infrastructure into code, bringing your servers and services to life. Whether you’re operating in the cloud, on-premises, or a hybrid, Chef automates how applications are configured, deployed, and managed across your network, no matter its size.</p> <p>Chef is built around simple concepts: achieving desired state, centralized modeling of IT infrastructure, and resource primitives that serve as building blocks. These concepts enable you to quickly manage any infrastructure with Chef. These very same concepts allow Chef to handle the most difficult infrastructure challenges on the planet. Anything that can run the chef-client can be managed by Chef.</p>  <h2 id="chef-components">Chef Components</h2> <p>The following diagram shows the relationships between the various elements of Chef, including the nodes, the server, premium features of the server, and the workstation. These elements work together to provide the chef-client the information and instruction that it needs so that it can do its job. As you are reviewing the rest of this topic, use the icons in the tables to refer back to this image.</p> <img src="https://docs.chef.io/release/12-9/_images/chef_overview.svg" width="600px">  <p>Chef has the following major components:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="20%"> <col width="80%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">

Therefore, Chef makes as few decisions on its own as possible. When a decision must be made, the chef-client uses a reasonable default setting that can be easily changed. While Chef encourages the use of the tooling packaged in the Chef development kit, none of these tools should be seen as a requirement or pre-requisite for being successful using Chef.</p>  <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3> <p>Some important components of workstations include:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="19%"> <col width="81%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">

<p class="first">A cookbook version represents a set of functionality that is different from the cookbook on which it is based. A version may exist for many reasons, such as ensuring the correct use of a third-party component, updating a bug fix, or adding an improvement. A cookbook version is defined using syntax and operators, may be associated with environments, cookbook metadata, and/or run-lists, and may be frozen (to prevent unwanted updates from being made).</p> <p class="last">A cookbook version is maintained just like a cookbook, with regard to source control, uploading it to the Chef server, and how the chef-client applies that cookbook when configuring nodes.</p> </td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">

<p class="first">A run-list defines all of the information necessary for Chef to configure a node into the desired state. A run-list is:</p> <ul class="last simple"> <li>An ordered list of roles and/or recipes that are run in the exact order defined in the run-list; if a recipe appears more than once in the run-list, the chef-client will not run it twice</li> <li>Always specific to the node on which it runs; nodes may have a run-list that is identical to the run-list used by other nodes</li> <li>Stored as part of the node object on the Chef server</li> <li>Maintained using knife, and then uploaded from the workstation to the Chef server, or is maintained using the Chef management console</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>    <h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2> <p>The Chef Analytics platform is a feature of Chef that provides real-time visibility into what is happening on the Chef server, including what’s changing, who made those changes, and when they occurred. Individuals may be notified of these changes in real-time.

<img src="https://docs.chef.io/release/12-9/_images/icon_controls.svg" width="100px">  </td> <td>A control is an automated test that is built into a cookbook, and then used to test the state of the system for compliance. Compliance can be many things. For example, ensuring that file and directory management meets specific internal IT policies—”Does the file exist?”, “Do the correct users or groups have access to this directory?”. Compliance may also be complex, such as helping to ensure goals defined by large-scale compliance frameworks such as PCI, HIPAA, and Sarbanes-Oxley can be met.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>   <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Chef is a thin DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of Ruby. This approach allows Chef to provide just enough abstraction to make reasoning about your infrastructure easy. Chef includes a built-in taxonomy of all the basic resources one might configure on a system, plus a defined mechanism to extend that taxonomy using the full power of the Ruby language. Ruby was chosen because it provides the flexibility to use both the simple built-in taxonomy, as well being able to handle any customization path your organization requires.</p><div class="_attribution">
