<h1 class="title">The Rust Programming Language</h1> <p>Welcome! This book will teach you about the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust Programming Language</a>. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren’t good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a number of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’ even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language. Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.</p> <p>“The Rust Programming Language” is split into chapters. This introduction is the first. After this:</p> <ul> <li>
