<h1>HTML</h1> <p><span class="seoSummary">HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the most basic building block of a webpage and used for creating and visually representing a webpage. It determines the content of a webpage, but not its functionality.</span></p> <p>HTML adds "markup" to standard English text. Hyper Text refers to links that connect Web pages to one another, making the World Wide Web what it is today. By creating and uploading Web pages to the Internet, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web once your site is online. HTML supports visual images and other media as well. With the help of HTML everyone can make static as well as dynamic web sites. HTML is the language that describes the structure and the semantic content of a web document. Content within a web page is tagged with HTML elements such as <a title="The HTML &lt;head&gt; element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets." href="element/head"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;title&gt; element defines the title of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text, and any contained tags are ignored." href="element/title"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;body&gt; Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one &lt;body&gt; element in a document." href="element/body"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;article&gt; element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an object, or any other independent item of content. Each &lt;article&gt; should be identified, typically by including a heading (&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; element) as a child of the &lt;article&gt; element." href="element/article"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;section&gt; element represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Each &lt;section&gt; should be identified, typically by including a heading (&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; element) as a child of the &lt;section&gt; element." href="element/section"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;p&gt; element (or HTML Paragraph Element) represents a paragraph of text." href="element/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;div&gt; element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element (such as &lt;article&gt; or &lt;nav&gt;) is appropriate." href="element/div"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;span&gt; element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang." href="element/span"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;img&gt; element represents an image in the document." href="element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a>, <a title="The HTML &lt;picture&gt; element is a container used to specify multiple &lt;source&gt; elements for a specific &lt;img&gt; contained in it. The browser will choose the most suitable source according to the current layout of the page (the constraints of the box the image will appear in) and the device it will be displayed on (e.g. a normal or hiDPI device.)" href="element/picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a>, and so forth. These elements form the building blocks of a website.</p> <p>The articles here provide reference materials for web development.</p> <section id="sect1" class="cleared"> <ul class="card-grid"> <li>

This article helps to explain what this means.</dd> <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="cors_enabled_image">CORS Enabled Image</a></dt> <dd class="landingPageList">The HTML specification introduces a <code><a href="element/img#attr-crossorigin">crossorigin</a></code> attribute for images that, in combination with an appropriate <a title="CORS: It is insecure to allow a webpage to request any resources from any other domains without limitation. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system that determines whether to block or fulfill these requests." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS" class="glossaryLink">CORS</a> header, allows images defined by the <a title="The HTML Image Element (&lt;img&gt;) represents an image of the document." href="element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> element loaded from foreign origins to be used in canvas as if they were being loaded from the current origin.</dd> <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="cors_settings_attributes">CORS Settings Attributes</a></dt> <dd class="landingPageList">In HTML5, some HTML elements which provide support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">CORS</a>, such as <a title="The HTML Image Element (&lt;img&gt;) represents an image of the document." href="element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> or <a title="The HTML &lt;video&gt; element is used to embed video content.

For example, both of them can be used for statistical usage purposes, tracking the number of clicks on certain links of a page, measuring the amount of time an element is focused, and so forth. In addition, when combined with AJAX technology, they help minimize the number of requests to the server, depending on the user activity and the page layout.</dd> <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="global_attributes">Global Attributes</a></dt> <dd class="landingPageList">Global attributes may be specified on all <a href="element">HTML elements</a>, <em>even those not specified in the standard</em>. That means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant. For example, HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as <code>&lt;foo hidden&gt;...&lt;foo&gt;</code><code>, </code>even though <code>&lt;foo&gt;</code> is not a valid HTML element.</dd> <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="attributes">HTML Attribute Reference</a></dt> <dd class="landingPageList">Elements in HTML have <strong>attributes</strong>; these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.</dd> <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="element">HTML Element Reference</a></dt> <dd class="landingPageList">This page lists all the <a title="HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML" class="glossaryLink">HTML</a> <a title="elements: An element is a part of a webpage.

The HTML parser in Firefox 4 and its later versions support speculative parsing off the main thread. It parses ahead while scripts are being downloaded and executed. In Firefox 3.5 and 3.6, the HTML parser starts speculative loads for scripts, style sheets and images it finds ahead in the stream. However, in Firefox 4 and later the HTML parser also runs the HTML tree construction algorithm speculatively. The upside is that when a speculation succeeds, there's no need to reparse the part of the incoming file that was already scanned for scripts, style sheets and images. The downside is that there's more work lost when the speculation fails.</dd> <dt class="landingPageList"><a href="using_the_application_cache">Using the Application Cache</a></dt> <dd class="landingPageList">
<a title="HTML/HTML5" href="html5">HTML5</a> provides an <em>application caching</em> mechanism that lets web-based applications run offline.
